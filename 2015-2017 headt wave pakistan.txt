A severe heat wave with temperatures as high as 49 °C (120 °F) struck southern Pakistan in June 2015. It caused the deaths of about 2,000 people from dehydration and heat stroke, mostly in Sindh province and its capital city, Karachi.[1][2][3] The heat wave also claimed the lives of zoo animals[4] and countless agricultural livestock.[5] The event followed a separate heat wave in neighboring India that killed 2,500 people in May 2015.[6]

Karachi recorded its highest temperatures since 1979.[9] By 24 June 2015, the temperature and death toll began to abate; the maximum temperature in Karachi was 37 °C (98 °F), and officials reported 58 deaths compared to 300 the previous day.[4]

Asif Shuja, the former director general of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, claimed the heat wave was a symptom of global climate change, aggravated by deforestation, expansion of asphalt superhighways, and rapid urbanisation. He maintained that "there has been a rise in the Earth's average temperature from 15.5 °C (59.9 °F) to 16.2 °C (61.2 °F) over the last 100 years, due to which we are experiencing such extreme weather conditions both in summers and winters." Shuja went on to say that the lack of sophisticated weather prediction technology in Pakistan contributed to the casualties of the heat wave.[7]

Moreover, widespread failures of the electrical grid left many locations without working air-conditioners, fans, or water pumps, adding further to the death toll.[4] Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tasked a committee comprising Abdul Qadir Baloch, a retired General of the Pakistan Army and Minister for States and Frontier Regions, together with State Minister for Health Sciences Regulation and Coordination Saira Afzal Tarar. The two Ministers visited Karachi's Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in the wake of deaths due to the severe heat wave. Speaking to the media during their visit, Baloch said that the K-Electric was being investigated for load shedding.[10] Baloch held the K-Electric, KW&SB and Sindh government responsible for the increase in heat wave mortality in Karachi.[11] The power regulator NEPRA reported that K-Electric was not generating electricity according to its generation capacity.[12]

The heat wave coincided with the month of Ramadan, when Muslims observe fasting and no drinking from dawn till dark. This increased the risks of dehydration and heat stroke.[13]

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared a state of emergency, activated military relief efforts,[9] and warned electric supply companies that he would not tolerate power outages during Ramadan. The Sindh government declared an emergency for all government hospitals in the province, and the University of Karachi postponed its exams for at least one month.[14] An influential Muslim cleric in Pakistan decreed a fatwa that if "a religious and qualified doctor" advises (for safety of life), Muslims are allowed to skip or break their Ramadan daytime fast, and then to complete those days of fasting when Ramadan and the emergency have passed.[13] At the peak of the June 2015 heat wave, the number of corpses exceeded local capacities for storage or burial, as the emergency efforts proved insufficient to prevent enormous loss of life.[5][15]

In April 2017, a severe heat wave with temperatures as high as 51 °C (124 °F) hit Pkmb, especially its southern parts.[2][3] This heat wave broke the old temperature records of many cities in the country for the month of April.[4] Larkana, a city in the southern province of Sindh, experienced the highest maximum temperature of 51.0 °C on 20 April,[5] breaking the previous day's record of 50 °C.[6]

In late March 2017, a heatwave engulfed most parts of the Sindh province as Nawabshah and Larkana registered 43 °C.[2]

The severe heat wave turned April 2017 as the hottest April passed during the last two decades. On 17 April, Sukkur recorded 47 °C breaking its earlier record of 46.5 °C on 25 April 2000. The temperature in Multan reached 45.1 °C which broke its previous record during the month of April of 44.7 °C recorded on 19 April 2010. Similarly, Khanpur leveled its previous maximum temperature of 46.5 °C recorded on 27 April 1993. In Faisalabad, maximum temperature reached 44.5 °C compared to its previous maximum temperature of 44 °C recorded on 29 April 2007.[7]

On 19 April, four Pakistani cities witnessed the hottest days of their history in the month of April, including Larkana (50 °C), Moenjo Daro (49 °C), Sibi (49 °C) and Lahore (45 °C).[6] Previously, the maximum temperature recorded in Lahore during April was 44 °C on 18 April 2010.[7] On 20 April, Larkana recorded 51 °C as maximum temperature, while the meteorological office at Moenjodaro Airport recorded the temperature at 50 °C.[5] On 21–22 April, dust storms and light rain over upper parts of the country and in north-east Punjab broke the heat spell but damaged wheat and other crops.[8]

However, most parts of Sindh continued to experience an early summer. On 1 May, Nawabshah and Mithi recorded the maximum temperature of 44.5 °C.[9] On 5 May, the heat wave claimed four lives in Hyderabad which recorded temperature at 45 °C.[1]
