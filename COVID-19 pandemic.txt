The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of Asia and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 10 March 2023, the pandemic had caused more than 676 million cases and 6.88 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.

COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if contaminated fluids reach the eyes, nose, or mouth, or, more rarely, through contaminated surfaces. Infected individuals are typically contagious for 10 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence.[5][6]

The COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and widely distributed in various countries since December 2020. According to a June 2022 study, COVID-19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 million to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020, to 8 December 2021.[7][8] Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing masks, improving ventilation and air filtration, and quarantining those who have been exposed or are infected. Treatments include novel antiviral drugs and symptom control. Public health mitigation measures include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and contact tracing of the infected, which, together with treatments, serve to bring about the control and eventual end of the pandemic.

The pandemic has triggered severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[9] Widespread supply shortages, including food shortages, were caused by supply chain disruptions. Reduced human activity led to an unprecedented decrease in pollution. Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed in many jurisdictions, and many events were cancelled or postponed during 2020 and 2021. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions have intensified. The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights.

While the WHO still considers the pandemic active,[10] some countries are transitioning their public health approach towards regarding SARS-CoV-2 as an endemic virus.[11][12]

The pandemic is known by several names. It is sometimes referred to as the "coronavirus pandemic"[13] despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. SARS).[14]

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",[15] "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak",[16] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[17][18] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[19] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[20] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[21] WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.[22] Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[23] WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[22]

WHO names variants of concern and variants of interest using Greek letters. The initial practice of naming them according to where the variants were identified (e.g. Delta began as the "Indian variant") is no longer common.[24] A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant's PANGO lineage (e.g., Omicron's lineage is B.1.1.529) and is used for other variants.[25][26][27]

SARS-CoV-2 is a virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[28] pangolin coronaviruses,[29][30] and SARS-CoV.[31] The first known outbreak (the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China) started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in November 2019. Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there,[32][33][34] but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier.[35][36]

The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of a zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal.[35][37][38] Controversies about the origins of the virus heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China.[39]

The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1 December 2019. That individual did not have a connection with the later wet market cluster.[40][41] However, an earlier case may have occurred on 17 November.[42] Two-thirds of the initial case cluster were linked with the market.[43][44][45] Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected between mid-October and mid-November 2019.[46][47]

Official "case" counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced symptomatic disease.[48][49] Due to the effect of sampling bias, studies which obtain a more accurate number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections considerably exceed the reported case counts.[50][51] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[52][53] The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity, complications of diabetes, anxiety disorders, and the total number of conditions.[54]

In early 2020, a meta-analysis of self-reported cases in China by age indicated that a relatively low proportion of cases occurred in individuals under 20.[55] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested.[56] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[57]

Among more thorough studies, preliminary results from 9 April 2020, found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 per cent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies.[58] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported.[59][60] Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[61]

Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January 2020 were between 1.4 and 2.5,[62] but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 per cent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[63]

In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors, including new COVID-19 variants. As of that 28 December, 282,790,822 individuals worldwide had been confirmed as infected.[64] As of 14 April 2022, over 500 million cases were confirmed globally.[65] Most cases are unconfirmed, with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimating the true number of cases as of early 2022 to be in the billions.[66][67]
