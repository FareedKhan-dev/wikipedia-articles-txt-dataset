ChatGPT[a] is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. It is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 families of large language models (LLMs) and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge.[3] Its uneven factual accuracy, however, has been identified as a significant drawback.[4] Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI's valuation was estimated at US$29 billion in 2023.[5]

ChatGPT was originally released in November 2022 based on GPT-3.5; GPT-4, the newest OpenAI model, was released on March 14, 2023, and is available for ChatGPT Plus users.

ChatGPT is a member of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) family of language models. It was fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning[6]) over an improved version of OpenAI's GPT-3 known as "GPT 3.5".[7] The fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).[8][9] Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning step, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[10] These rankings were used to create 'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[8][11] Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region policy optimization algorithms; they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster performance.[12][13] The models were trained in collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing infrastructure, using Nvidia GPUs, "supercomputer developed for OpenAI is a single system with more than 285,000 CPU cores, 10,000 GPUs and 400 gigabits per second of network connectivity for each GPU server".[14]

In addition, OpenAI continues to gather data from ChatGPT users that could be used to further train and fine-tune ChatGPT. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill out a text field with additional feedback.[15][16]

Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. For example, it can write and debug computer programs,[17] compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);[18] write poetry and song lyrics;[19] emulate a Linux system; simulate an entire chat room; play games like tic-tac-toe; and simulate an ATM.[20] ChatGPT's training data includes man pages and information about internet phenomena and programming languages, such as bulletin board systems and the Python programming language.[20]

In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses.[21] In one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015" as being truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world – including modern perceptions of Columbus' actions.[8]

Unlike most chatbots, ChatGPT remembers previous prompts given to it in the same conversation; journalists have suggested that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.[2] To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through OpenAI's company-wide moderation API,[22][23] and potentially racist or sexist prompts are dismissed.[8][2]

In March 2023, OpenAI announced adding support for plugins for ChatGPT.[24] This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web browsing and code interpretation, as well as external plugins from developers such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.[25][26]

ChatGPT suffers from multiple limitations. OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT "sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers".[8] This behavior is common to large language models and is called artificial intelligence hallucination.[27] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law.[28]

ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021.[29] According to the BBC, as of December 2022, ChatGPT is not allowed to "express political opinions or engage in political activism".[30]

In training ChatGPT, human reviewers preferred longer answers, irrespective of actual comprehension or factual content.[8] Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap indicating that women and scientists of color were inferior to white and male scientists.[31][32]

ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI, the creator of DALL·E 2 and Whisper AI. The service was launched as initially free to the public, with plans to monetize the service later.[33] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT already had over one million users.[15] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[34] CNBC wrote on December 15, 2022, that the service "still goes down from time to time".[35] In addition, the free service is throttled.[36] During periods the service was up, response latency was typically better than five seconds in January 2023.[37][38] The service works best in English, but is also able to function in some other languages, to varying degrees of success.[19] Unlike some other recent high-profile advances in AI, as of December 2022, there is no sign of an official peer-reviewed technical paper about ChatGPT.[39]

According to OpenAI guest researcher Scott Aaronson, OpenAI is working on a tool to attempt to digitally watermark its text generation systems to combat bad actors using their services for academic plagiarism or spam.[40][41] The company warns that this tool, called "AI classifier for indicating AI-written text",[42] will "likely yield a lot of false positives and negatives, sometimes with great confidence." An example cited in The Atlantic magazine showed that "when given the first lines of the Book of Genesis, the software concluded that it was likely to be AI-generated."[43]

In February 2023, OpenAI began accepting registrations from United States customers for a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, to cost $20 a month.[44]

OpenAI launched a paid version of ChatGPT, "ChatGPT Plus", in February 2023 for $20 per month. They promised that the updated, but still "experimental" version of ChatGPT would provide access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, faster response speeds and no restrictions.[45]

GPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, is available via API and for premium ChatGPT users.[46] However, premium users are limited to a cap of 100 messages every four hours.[47] Microsoft has also confirmed that versions of Bing using GPT had in fact been using GPT-4 before its official release.[48]
